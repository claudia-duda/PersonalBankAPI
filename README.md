## About this project
It was developed with a view to registering three types of financial transactions: withdraw, deposits, and transfers. The main idea is to have control of all your financial transactions that must follow according to your current balance. You will have space to update, edit, search, list and delete each transaction that has been registered, which may impact your current balance.

Next steps
- Develop unit tests for each entity using XUnit, implementing them separately by responsibility (service, repository, etc)
- Improve the account model to allow for individualized registration
- Create an authentication and authorization system to view transactions according to the user type
- Integrate with the frontend <a href="https://github.com/claudia-duda/PersonalBank">PersonalBank</a>
- Deploy the application in a production environment for external access.(Heroku/Docker)
